hi im techie HP commited to learn hardware description language (VHDL) in Very high speed integrated circuits.

Keypoints:
     # VHDL is not a software its a Hardware Description language
     # FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Array
     # FPGA are nothing but we are going to design the logic cells are arranged in array which is used as processsor
     # There are three types of level to design a fpga they are,
                 1.Behavourial Level
                 2.Gate Level
                 3.Logic Level
     # We are going to design the fpga by using flow of firstly Behavourial to gate level synthesis then logic level then check the results as waveforms.
     # Xilinx by AMD are used for the design as VIVADO
     # ALtera by INTEL are also used for the design as Quartus
