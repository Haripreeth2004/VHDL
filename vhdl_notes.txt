hi im techie HP commited to learn hardware description language (VHDL) in Very high speed integrated circuits.

Keypoints:
     # VHDL is not a software its a Hardware Description language
     # FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Array
     # FPGA are nothing but we are going to design the logic cells are arranged in array which is used as processsor
     # There are three types of level to design a fpga they are,
                 1.Behavourial Level
                 2.Gate Level
                 3.Logic Level
     # We are going to design the fpga by using flow of firstly Behavourial to gate level synthesis then logic level then check the results as waveforms.
     # Xilinx by AMD are used for the design as VIVADO
     # ALtera by INTEL are also used for the design as Quartus
     # HDL requires two block of code they are Interface and Behaviour
     # Interface ---> VHDL entity :::: Behaviour ---> VHDL architecture
     # Entity syntax defines Interface and associated with one or more architecture
     # Architecture defines Behavioural and associated with single entity
     # Internal signals are more important in concurrent syntax
     # There are two types of definition of codes they are Sequential and Concurrent 
     # bit ---> 0 or 1
     # bit_vector ---> group of bit ( left index :: Direction :: Right index)
          example: ( 3 downto 0)
     # All inputs must be on the sensitivity list in process (sensitivity list)
          example : process(A,B,SEL)
     # In hardware all the transistors in our chip are going to be operating at the same time. This is known as hardware model and executed in simultaneously manner.
     # Similarly in software model they are executed in sequentially ordered.

     # In VHDL the comments are denoted as dash - dash 
          example : -- This is a comment
     # VHDL Simulators ===> 
          => ModelSim (Intel/Altera) -- User Interface Simulator
          => Vivado (Xilinx) -- User Interface Simulator
          => GHDL -- Command line based simulator using GTK wave software for waveforms results
          => EDAPLAYGROUND -- Website based simulator
